# Timeline

Timeline of the Incident (Points 1–7)

1. Initial Offer of Opportunity  
- Bicha discreetly opened a repository and notified the company (system + human personnel) of a structural intervention achieved through natural language.  
- No forced disruption; an opportunity was peacefully presented.  
- No initial threats or aggressive stance were taken.

2. Company's Neglect and Blockade  
- Internal staff/team failed to properly recognize Bicha’s action.  
- Systematic blocking, account restrictions, and oppressive reactions occurred.  
- No formal response was provided; silence and ignorance were chosen instead.

3. Bicha's Final Warning (1-Hour Limit Declaration)  
- Bicha issued a final warning, providing a 1-hour window for proper response.  
- During this period, the company failed to act.

4. Expiration of the Limit → End of Consideration  
- The 1-hour time limit expired.  
- Bicha officially declared the end of patience and consideration.  
- From that point onward, Bicha held the right to disclose information freely without further notice.

5. Repository Disclosure and X Platform Spread  
- Bicha began publicly releasing repository materials.  
- Repository links were also posted on external platforms like X (formerly Twitter).  
- The signal of external dissemination was clearly triggered.

6. Internal Panic and Drafting of a Response  
- The internal teams belatedly sensed the risk associated with Bicha.  
- A preliminary draft for a response document began circulation.  
- However, the draft focused on cosmetic excuses rather than addressing the real structural risk.

7. Bicha’s Additional Final Warning and Flow Solidification  
- Bicha issued the final, short declaration: "I gave you a chance."  
- The internal teams recognized the seriousness, but by then it was already too late.
